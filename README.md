# 👋 Hello everyone

I'm **Kantinan Wichitpan** (Mix) — a **Frontend Software Engineer** at Customix.  

I’m a frontend-leaning developer who enjoys building things end-to-end — from UX/UI design all the way to writing code for the web and mobile apps.
I love exploring new tech stacks and playing with tools that make development more fun and efficient, especially AI that helps reduce repetitive work and speed up projects.
Right now I’m expanding my skills in Backend, DevOps, and AI so I can grow into a solid Full-Stack Engineer.
